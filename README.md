# BjjB Landing Page

> Render a website's landing page using React to animate different video components

![screenshot](public/img/Screenshot.png)

BJJB is a translation agency serving in Barranquilla, Colombia. They needed a website to close new deals. I created a simple website to showcase their services and connect a simple contact form with their manager account. The project is just a start and we plan to build a blog functionality as well as the same webpage in different languages. For now, we have created the page in Spanish which is their base language for most of their clients.
